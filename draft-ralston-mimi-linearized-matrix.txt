Abstract

   Matrix is an existing openly specified decentralized secure
   communications protocol able to provide a framework for instant
   messaging interoperability.  Matrix rooms currently use a Directed
   Acyclic Graph (DAG) for persisting events/messages.  Servers
   broadcast their changes to the DAG to every other server in order to
   create new events.

   This model provides excellent decentralization characteristics,
   however is complex when aiming to adopt Matrix as an interoperable
   chat protocol, such as with the emergence of the European Union's
   Digital Markets Act (DMA).

   This document explores an API surface for Matrix which knowingly
   trades some of the decentralization aspects for ease of
   interoperability at a per-room level.  We call this API surface
   "Linearized Matrix".

1.  Introduction

   At a high level, rooms using Linearized Matrix have a single server
   which owns that room.  The owner can change, but will typically be
   the server which created the room.  All other servers are known as
   participating servers and call the owner server to send events.  The
   owner server is then responsible for informing all the other servers
   of any changes/messages in the room.

   Many aspects for how Matrix works as an interoperable messaging
   framework is described by [I-D.ralston-mimi-matrix-framework].  This
   document replaces the eventual consistency model, federation API, and
   DAG-related features of the framework document by presenting a
   simpler interface for interacting with Matrix rooms, without being
   incompatible with those same replaced components.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Security Considerations

   TODO: Security * We sign events to prevent the owner server lying.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
